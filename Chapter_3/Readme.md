What host are you on?

  Brookss-MBP:Chapter_3 $ hostname
  Brookss-MBP.skybeam.com
  
  I am currently hosted on the skybeam.com domain.

Are you on your local machine?

  Brookss-MBP:~ $ scutil --get ComputerName
  Brooksâ€™s MacBook Pro
  
  Brookss-MBP:~ $ scutil --get LocalHostName
  Brookss-MacBook-Pro
  
  Brookss-MBP:~ $ hostname -s
  Brookss-MBP

  Since the ComputerName, the LocalHostName, and the hostname -s, all
  begin with "Brooks," it's safe to assume the answer is "yes."
