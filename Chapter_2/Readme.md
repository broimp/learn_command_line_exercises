What directory are you in?
  
  Brookss-MBP:~ $ pwd
  /Users/bi
  
  The /users/bi directory.
  
Are you in the class directory?

  Brookss-MBP:~ $ pwd
  /Users/bi
  
  Brookss-MBP:~ $ cd workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/
  
  Brookss-MBP:davinci_coders_t1_2016 $ pwd
  /Users/bi/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016

  Now I am.
  
Are you in the home directory?

  rookss-MBP:davinci_coders_t1_2016 $ echo $HOME
  /Users/bi  
  
  Brookss-MBP:davinci_coders_t1_2016 $ pwd
  /Users/bi/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016

  No. The home directory is /users/bi. I'm in the class dir.
  
What directory did you run that command in?

  See previous answer. I ran that command in the class directory.

Explain the process for finding the path with your graphical file browser (Finder).

  Click on the Finder.
  Enter "learn_command_line_exercises" in the search field.
  Click on the item that has the blue folder, indicating a directory.
  This brings up a list of Chapter directories in the folder.
  Click on the arrows to expose their files and subdirectories as necessary.
  
  Once you find an item, file or directory, in Finder, you can put a copy
    of the complete path to that item by two finger clicking on the item,
    which brings up a menu of options. Go down to the line that says Copy
    "item name" and click it. This puts the complete path into your copy
    buffer, whence you can Cmd-V paste it at terminal level as an argument to
    commands like CD and RM.
